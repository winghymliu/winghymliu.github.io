What's the point of blogging? Why should we blog? People say, "Oh you code, you should blog", so here I am sitting in Timberyard next some friends on our weekly 'let's do something productive' meetups writing my first entry. 

Despite how easy it looks, I've been staring at the screen for about 20mins trying to think of what to write. Writer's block? I think I'm giving myself too much credit to describe it like that. To make things easier I'll start with a simple standard introduction. 

My name's Wing (if you haven't already inferred it from the title) and started programming in 2006 when I started the computing course at Imperial College London. I still remember the first lecture when Haskell lecturer Tony Field asked 'How many of you have written thousands of lines of code already?', I kept my hand down looked around and saw quite of large number hands in the air, quite an anxious moment for someone with no programming experience. 

Fast forward to 2015, I've graduated with a masters and now have accumulated about 5 years of professional experience (Goldman Sachs, NHS, Duetsche Bank, Sporting Index and now Huddle). In the next posts I will be writing about my experience with certain technologies and hopefully write up a few tutorials as well.
